# THIS VERSION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
# TERMUX-CONTAINER v9.5, A NEW START.
# This version will only use English, no multi-language support.
I developed [ruri](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri), [rootfstool](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/rootfstool) and [yoshinon](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/yoshinon) for v9.5, but not only for termux, they are for GNU/Linux.      
I'm currently developing [ruri](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri) that makes the chroot Linux containers on Android more secure.      
As this project becomes more and more large, it's too hard for me to maintain the Chinese version at the same time, so this version will be English only.
